## Call for Action
- Create and support institutions that advance and promote the quality, longevity, and (re)usability of science software.
- Promote cooperation among funding agencies, commercial and non-profit software developers, and professional societies.
- Support education and workforce development activities that lead to improved software code and that promulgate research reproducibility and transparency.
- Establish criteria for preserving and sharing software code associated with published scientific results.
- Incentivize researchers to document, archive and share software code.

## Call for Action (merge with previous section)

Technological advances are creating outstanding new opportunities for investigating challenging science research questions at levels of detail and generality that were impossible in the past.  Full realization of technological potential, however, requires that the scientific community far more effectively develop, reuse, extend, and share software and analyses than is currently the case.  Notable advances in sharing and preserving scientific research data (ref Data Repos doc?) should now be accompanied by similar attention to the codes, programs, models, and applications that we use to collect, organize, simulate, and interpret scientific phenomena. While data provide the evidence for understanding natural phenomena, it is the software used to analyze and interpret the data that enables scientific insight.

In this document, we have identified some fundamental principles for building a more robust, efficient, and accessible software ecosystem to empower scientific investigations. There are potentially a number of mechanisms by which these principles can be advanced, including, e.g.
Software Institutes to promote awareness of tools, articulate best practices for varying scientific communities, and develop new and optimize existing algorithms to fill critical gaps in existing analyses; or building communities of practice that more fully integrate computational thinking into traditional science research programs. Moreover, as the technology gap between potential and practice continues to grow, mechanisms are critically needed to educate, train, and support scientific researchers in software development and use, in ways that minimize unwarranted duplication of effort, and facilitate maximal reuse and extensibility of prior work.

This document outlines principles intended to broadly apply to software for research science.  It is our hope that discussion and refinement of these principles over the coming months will lead to prospective strategies and solutions for resolving these issues in ways that catalyze far more powerful and effective use of scientific software across many domains.
