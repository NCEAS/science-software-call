## Challenges in Science Software

Technological advances are creating outstanding new opportunities for investigating challenging science research questions at levels of detail and generality that were impossible in the past.  Full realization of technological potential, however, requires that the scientific community far more effectively develop, reuse, extend, and share software and analyses than is currently the case.  Many barriers exist, including:

- Isolated development
    - The development of science software typically is done in isolation, within individual investigator labs and coded for single use.
- Need for training
    - Most scientists are not trained in software development, but need to be.
- Code complexity
    - Scientific codes can become massively complex, and would benefit from the use of common design patterns from the software world
- Lack of formal development processes (e.g., testing, code review, version control)

We believe that fundamental change in all of these areas would significantly increase the pace of science. Notable advances in sharing and preserving scientific research data (ref Data Repos doc?) should now be accompanied by similar attention to the codes, programs, models, and applications that we use to collect, organize, simulate, and interpret scientific phenomena. While data provide the evidence for understanding natural phenomena, it is the software used to analyze and interpret the data that enables scientific insight.
