## Activities/Goals
- To create a future that recognizes software as an essential component to the research enterprise, we agree on the following approach to achieve a vision where science and software are symbiotic in advancing the values highlighted above:
- Software engineers and domain researchers must work closely together to solve software problems that impede science. Code-a-thons and working groups are two approaches to achieve this.
- Researchers and developers need to be trained in best practices for scientific software development.
- Cross-community collaboration requires a shared multi-level workspace. 
- Professional societies, user groups and commercial software providers are recognized as key stakeholders in scientific software development.
