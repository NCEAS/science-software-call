## Preamble
Recent advances in scientific software have revolutionized discovery and invention throughout the sciences.  However there are many missed opportunities for advance due to a lack of coordination and failure to follow best practices in scientific software development [Wilson et al.](http://doi.org/doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745).  Efforts such as the [Science Code Manifesto](http://sciencecodemanifesto.org/) show that software is widely reconized as a cornerstone for science, and yet most scientists rarely consider software issues in their daily practices.  We believe that open software is critical to the transparency and reproducibility of science; that open data and open science efforts require open software; that engaging scientific societies and user groups throughout the software lifecycle is critical to scientific advance; that software reuse is relatively rare but should not be; that sustainable scientific software requires investment from diverse sectors; and that research software organizations that effectively coordinate and focus scientific software must be community driven via participatory governance models.
