We are missing many opportunities for scientific advance due to a lack of coordination between scientists and software developers, and computer scientists.  This is a call for action to change that situation. We plan to spend the next month in community editing mode to produce a call for action that we as a community support, and then we plan to call for signatories to that call to guage support.

We welcome comments and proposed revisions.  The document can be edited in one of two ways, described below.
